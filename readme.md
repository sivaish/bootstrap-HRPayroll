### `Node cache memory Infomation`
1. For simple demo purpose have used node cache memory alternativelly can use any Database of File System to store the Payslip for audit purpose.
2. The cache memory will be active for 15 minutes.

### `Summary`
1. Included Employee ID in the input form - To make the data unique - Since more than one employee can have same First Name and Last Name.
2. The date module will generate last business day - Not implemented the Month and Year picker - So the payslip is limited to generate for the current month. 
[Note : Month picker has been implemented in React stack]
3. The Primary combination to the backend is Employee ID and Pay Date - If an employee is paid for a particular period/month then the payslip/payment is rejected by the server and not added to the DB/storage.
